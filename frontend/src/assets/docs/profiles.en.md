# Who we are

We are a team of three young and passionate developers. Through our common workplace, the Federal Office for Information Technology and Telecommunication, where we are doing our apprenticeship, we were able to meet in the first place. Soon our apprenticeship will be over and we'll be making our way into the real working world.

Our team profits from the many differing interests which complement each other perfectly in Outcobra.

I am mostly responsible for what you see of Outcobra and with what you interact. The UX/UI-Design is very fascinating to me because it is one of the most diverse parts of an application and is still human after all.

My main goal for Outcobra is to create an exciting and comfortable experience for you.

When I am not busy enhancing your experience with Outcobra, I am most likely challenging myself with photography. Lately I could really get me excited about astrophotography. I still have to learn a lot, but I am quite proud of my latest results.

If I am neither holding a mouse nor my camera, I grab my Vic Firth Sticks and take a seat behind a drum set. I am also one of four Drummers/Percussionists of the Harmonic Wind Band Ins&MÃ¶rigen

The first contact with Computers I had in third grade. At that time I got my first own computer.

Thanks to the fact that I could use it in school, because of my physical disability, I rapidly spent a lot of time with it.

Five years later I began to teach programming myself.

Today I am in an apprenticeship as software developer with a focus on Quality Assurance. To be up to date with the current trends in development I realize many side projects.
Outcobra is to date my biggest one. I mainly focus on backend development and testing.

What fascinates me about the project is the challenge of many known and unknown things which confront me every time.

When I was twelve, my uncle gifted me a book about Python 3. That was when it clicked and I started teaching myself to program. Over the years I came in contact with many programming languages, but I've always found programming in Java and now also Kotlin to be really pleasant.

At my workplace, I work with similar technologies which are also present in Outcobra: Spring & Hibernate with ReST endpoints for the UI are there too.

I often spend my free time coding, which you can see from my multitude of small GitHub repositories. In addition, Linux servers have been a great joy for me lately: I own (including Outcobra's) five servers which host my emails, websites, tools and the whole Outcobra infrastructure. I enjoy exchanging knowledge with my colleagues which study systems engineering and experimenting with networks because I want to keep my IT-knowledge as broad as possible.
