Outcobra is currently only in a Beta state and so we have the most important features to make it usable.
We want to present you what we have at the moment and what you can expect from the future.

# Features
## Implemented
At the current state Outcobra consists of 3 main features and one management feature which is used as a base for all others.

Namely our features are:
 - Tasks
 - Exams
 - Noten

### Tasks
Outcobra allows you to create tasks for your subjects. Those tasks are presented to you in a clear list on which you can apply filters and make a search. 
Finished tasks can be marked as such and also be hidden in this list. You can also track the progress of a task by marking it as for instance 50% finished.

### Exams
The second feature is all about exams. Create an exam, assign it to a subject, set the date and add learning goals to it.
If you reached on learning goal you can mark it as finished. After the exam has passed you can directly create a mark from it.

### Marks
The mark feature allows you to manage all your marks over all your semesters and subjects. Each mark value has its own weight which influences the average note of a subject.
It is also possibly to combine marks in a group. For instance you can group every french oral exam in one group which has then its own weight.
From the marks, markgroups and their weights a subject and semester average will be calculated.

## Planned
 - timetable
 - mark report and export
 - combining of schoolyears and semesters
 - notifications for Tasks and Exams
 - enhanced sorting and filtering for Tasks and Exams
 -  drop grades
 - holidays for timetable
 - dashboard functionality
